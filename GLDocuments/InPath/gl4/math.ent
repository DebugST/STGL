<!-- 
    Math entities used by the Khronos man pages. The SYSTEM identifiers are
    for local copies rather than the normative URLs, because even though
    they are installed along with mathml2.dtd, they are not added to the XML
    catalog. %isoamsb and %isogrk3 are used only by the GLSL ref pages, the
    others are needed by both API and GLSL.
