<h1> OpenGL&reg; 4.5 Reference Pages </h1>

<p> Use the index on the left to choose any OpenGL 4.5 reference page for
    viewing. These pages include all of the important usage information for
    each command and function. This information includes a description of
    all parameters, return values, error conditions, related commands and
    functions, and version support. </p>

<p> There are two forms of the index which can be selected by clicking at
    the top of the navigation bar on the left side: a traditional flat index
    combining the API commands and GLSL functions, and an accordion-style
    index with separate sections for commands and functions. The flat index
    also includes per-letter section links. </p>


<h2> Core Context Functionality </h2>

<p> These man pages only document OpenGL 4.5 core context functionality. For
    compatibility context specific functionality, please refer to the <a
    href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl2.1/"> OpenGL
    2.1 Reference Pages </a> and/or the appropriate <a
    href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_gl.php"> extension
    specification </a> you are interested in using.</p>


<h2> Browser Compatibility </h2>

<p> Very old browsers, such as IE8, may not work with parts of this site.
    Please use modern browsers supporting HTML5 (e.g. IE9 and later). </p>

<p> The ref pages are generated in HTML5 format with imbedded MathML, and
    rely on <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render
    mathematical equations on browsers which do not natively support MathML.
    This should work on Chrome, Safari, and other browsers which don't
    support MathML natively. </p>


<h2> Downloading Man Page Sources </h2>

<p> The Docbook source for the reference pages is available from the <a
    href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages"> OpenGL-Refpages
    </a> github repository. </p>


<h2> Feedback </h2>

<p> If you find any inaccuracies or typos in the reference pages, please
    file an issue (and, preferably, propose a pull request fixing the issue)
    in the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Refpages">
    OpenGL-Refpages </a> github repository. </p>
